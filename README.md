->IPL Data Analysis & Match Outcome Predictability

  This project focuses on analyzing Indian Premier League (IPL) match data and building insights through visual dashboards and predictive analysis.

  The goal of this project is to:

* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Generate meaningful visualizations

* Analyze team and player performance

* Predict match outcomes based on historical data

-> Project Overview

The IPL is one of the biggest T20 cricket leagues in the world. This project analyzes IPL match datasets to uncover patterns such as:

* Average runs per match

* Toss impact on match results

* Team performance trends

* Venue influence

* Match outcome predictability

* The analysis is implemented using Python and visualized through dashboards.
